		<h2>The First Bicycle</h2>
		<p>Feedback from both instructors and students continues to make it clear that we have hit the mark with the overall vision of the book. The emphasis remains on presenting underlying core concepts in a clear and gradual man- ner. The Graphics Track sections in each chapter still segregate the coverage of graphics and graphical user interfaces, giving extreme flexibility in how that material gets covered. The casual writing style and entertaining examples still rule the day.</p>
		<h2>Further Innovations</h2>
		<p>The enhancements in this edition are designed to allow the instructor more flexibility in topic coverage. In an attempt to cover all issues related to condi- tionals and loops, Chapter 5 in the previous edition had become very large and a bit too encyclopedic. In this edition that chapter has been carefully redesigned into two, giving the coverage of those topics a better flow. The new organization allows more interesting examples to be explored earlier.</p>
